TODO :

- Clean food inspections to have only those in Chicago (not new york etc)
- See if there is a relation betw. the number before the violation and the description of the violation
- Check if possible to do time series on the map (change time -> see all inspections done at this day/month/year)
- Plot socioeconomic on the map (different layer than food inspections) and visualize results
- Save community area column after computing it (for food inspections)
- Write a few explanations on what is observed on the map
-> Should do more maps (express ratio nb facilities/ nb inspections, etc) :
	- facility types : barplot/scatterplot of their resp. risks or violations or nb of inspections
- Finish reporting basic stats
- Program milestone 3 and all the way up to presentation
	- Analyze and combine more in depth the databases
	- write a data story/report
	- ....
