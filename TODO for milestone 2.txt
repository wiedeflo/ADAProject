TODO :

- (DONE) Added hover effect with data for heatmaps
- (DONE) Clean food inspections to have only those in Chicago (not new york etc)
- (DONE) See if there is a relation betw. the number before the violation and the description of the violation
- Check if possible to do time series on the map (change time -> see all inspections done at this day/month/year)
- (DONE)Plot socioeconomic on the map (different layer than food inspections) and visualize results
- (DONE) Save community area column after computing it (for food inspections)
- (DONE) Write a few explanations on what is observed on the map
-> (DONE some maps) Should do more maps (express ratio nb facilities/ nb inspections, etc) :
	- facility types : barplot/scatterplot of their resp. risks or violations or nb of inspections
- Finish reporting basic stats
- Program milestone 3 and all the way up to presentation
	- description of the violations and it how they are influencing the risk of an establishment (mean of the numbers to determine the pass/failure conditions?)
	- See what other interesting analysis can be done by combining the databases
	- write a data story/report
	- Do ML to predict... something
