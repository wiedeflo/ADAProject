The map on the left displays the percentage of households below the poverty line for each area.
For reference at the time of the data was collected the federal poverty threshold in the US was 11 670$ per year for a single household.
We can see smaller clusters of areas with high poverty in the south, the mid-west and around Fuller Park, where in some areas there are more than 50% of the households below poverty.
In contrast to that in the south-east and especially the north we find areas where that number can be below 4%.
