  <p class="w3-large" align="justify">Chicago is a notoriously unequal city: Passengers travelling on its red metro line have life expectancies that vary by 30 years depending on their stop, according to The Economist. We want to investigate how geographical socio-economic divisions in Chicago reflect in food inspections in two ways: results to food inspections, and quantities of food inspections. By analysing results to food inspections, we want to find out which areas are performing better and which are performing worse, and compare this to measures of the socio-economic divide. By inspecting the quantity of inspections per area, we hope to gain insight on a potential bias in the choice of inspected establishment and whether the chances of an establishment getting inspected depend only on its performance or also on its location.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-grey" align="justify"> Chicago with its approximately 2.7 million inhabitants is one of the biggest cities in the US. The city is divided into 77 community areas which are displayed on the map to the left. The notorious socio-economic divide between community areas in Chicago will become clearer throughout our data story, and makes this city particularly interesting to analyse. The city center is located on the center-east of the displayed areas, next to Lake Michigan, and is composed of the three areas <i>Near North Side, Near South Side</i> and <i>Loop</i>. You can see the the name of a community area when hovering over it. <br>These community areas are divided into 9 regions, but we will first focus on each specific area before diving into their relationship with other areas of the same region.

           <br> In order to investigate the vast number of culinary establishments we used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections">Chicago Food Inspections</a> dataset provided by Kaggle and the city of Chicago.
           It contains information on the establishment and the results of every food inspection carried out since January 1<sup>st</sup> 2010. The maps on the right gives a raw overview of some of this data. Select below which data to display.

            The heatmap shows the number of inspections on the area we are focusing on.
            We can see that the more we approach the city center of Chicago, the higher the number of inspections.
            However, it is also curious to see that in the north of Chicago, the number of inspections is higher than in the south.
             This could be due to a higher amount of establishment in this area; we check this in the other map.

          <p class="w3-text-grey" align="justify"> As mentioned before Chicago is also notoriously unequal. Indeed, the life expectancy varies between 69 and 85 years depending on the areas.
            <br> In order to capture some of these socioeconomic factors we used the
           <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2">Cencus Data</a> and the

           They provide information on some important socioeconomic factors for each community area in Chicago. The maps on the left give a raw overview on some of the data from those sets. Select below which data to display.

          <p class="w3-text-grey" align="justify" id="intro_socio">Community areas around the center have the highest per capita income, but even there the difference is noticeable. One can check that <i>Near North Side, Lincoln Park</i> and <i>Loop</i> have the largest average per capita incomes of approximately 88'700$, 71'500$ and 65'500$ resp. which still shows a great difference. Indeed, <i>Near North Side</i> has average per capita income of roughly 30% more than <i>Loop</i> even though both are neighbours! Slightly to the south, between <i>Near South Side</i> and its neighbour <i>Armour Square</i>, the difference even larger, the first having an average per capita income of 59'000$ while the second only has around 16'000$.</p><br>

            We try and use ML to, based on a restaurant's previous history and some of its characteristics, predict whether it will get inspected in 2018. Using logistic regression and Monte Carlo cross-validation with 1000 iterations, we estimate a validation set accuracy of 61% (classes are balanced: We chose the period so that approximately half of the facilities would get inspected at that time and half wouldn't).

			However, it is not in the accuracy that the interest of this exercise lays, but in the weights the model assigns to each input variable, both categorical (after 1 hot encoding) and numerical (to which we apply MinMaxScaler) variables. The top 5 variables contributing positively are N_INSPECTIONS, AVERAGE_RISK, SHARED KITCHEN, SHELTER, HOSPITAL. The bottom 5 variables are LONG TERM CARE FACILITY, DAYCARE COMBO 1586, AVERAGE_RESULT, WRIGLEY ROOFTOP AND BAR/GRILL.

        <h4 align="left">Percentage of failing Restaurants and Stores vs. Percentage of Households below Poverty line</h4>
        <p class="w3-text-grey" align="justify">There is a correlation between the percentage of failed
          inspections of restaurants and stores and the percentage of households below the poverty line in areas of Chicago. Looking at the areas with highest percentage of failing restaurants and stores: Oakland, Washington Park and Riverdale, all three of them have over 40% of failed inspections. The percentage of households below the poverty line is also around 40% for the first two areas and over 56% for the last (!). It is curious that neighbour areas sometimes perform much better in both domains. For example Douglas, the northern neighbour of Oakland, has only around 21% failed inspections in restaurants and stores, and 30% households below poverty line. These numbers aren't great, but they are a lot better than its southern neighbour.
          <br>Of course the relation put in evidence here is not a dependence, but both features are at first glance indicators of how attractive a community can be. A community where more than a third of inspections fail might not be the most appealing, and the same goes for the percentage of households below the poverty line. The motivation behind keeping only restaurants and stores is that facilities such as hospitals or schools present higher risks, and are therefore more severely inspected. As those are more rare than restaurants and stores they might add some bias to specific communities, and so we choose to focus only on the latters.

        <h4 align="left">Community area per income below poverty</h4>
        <p> To further analyse the indicator of households below poverty line, we will now compare it to the average per capita income inside same community areas. As a plot depicting the poverty indices of community areas would be hard to geographically interpret, we now introduce the notion of <i>region</i> as defined by the city of Chicago and explained on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago">Wikipedia page</a>. There are 9 regions in Chicago, and each one of them contains a subset of community areas. It is easier to visualize the households below poverty line w.r.t the average per capita inside those regions than displaying 77 areas. On the plot below, you can click on the region names in the legend (below the plot) to put in evidence the community areas of the selected region. Hover over a point in the plot or on the map to see the name of the community area.
        <br>
        The legend consists of all regions of Chicago, with <i>All</i> displaying all regions and <i>Chicago</i> displaying the average of those indicators on the entire city. Clearly the <i>Central</i> region has the highest per capita incomes and few households below the poverty line (around 15%). The <i>North Side</i> region also seems to do very well in those measures, altough the community areas <i>Avondale</i> and <i>Logan Square</i> have much lower per capita incomes (around half of the other areas in the same regions), they have roughly the same percentage of households below the poverty line. In the southernmost regions, there seems to be a greater percentage of households under the poverty line. Indeed, when analysing <i>southwest side, south side, far southwest side</i> and <i>far southeast side</i>, one can check that community areas have around 20-30% of households below poverty line (although <i>far southwest side</i> is slightly better), the average per capita income rarely exceeds 30k and is usually around 20k, which is not a lot.
        <br> Displaying those two poverty metrics for different regions, one can see that the community areas in regions usually seem to share similar results. However there are some exceptions, which continues to show the economic divide in the areas. This can probably be explained by the fact that most high paying jobs are in the city center, as we could see on the previous per-capita income maps, but many wealthy people live in quiet neighbourhoods outside the center, where jobs don't pay as much.

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64" id="conclusion">
    <h1>Conclusion</h1><br>
    <p>Our goal was to investigate how geographical socio-economic divisions in Chicago reflect in food inspections. In order to do that, we analysed the results and the quantities of food inspections. By crossing those information with socioeconomics factors such as the per capita income and life expectancy of each neighbourhood we were able to gain powerful insights.<br>
    The results of the food inspections carried out show how the establishments in the richer areas are more inspected than the poorer ones and present higher average risk while obtaining better results. Indeed, establishments in poorer areas tend to have bad results.<br>
    We saw the link between the inspection result of a restaurant and the life expectancy on the area where the restaurant is.<br>
    Furthermore, we found out that facilities with higher risk are performing better and we arrived to that result by analysing the correlations between them.<br>
    Finally, we used machine learning to predict whether or not a facility would get inspected in 2018 and detected the features that contribute positively on the result.<br>
    As a future work, it would be great to look whether there is a correlation between the type of facility inspected (restaurant, hospital, tavern) and the results of the inspection.</p>
