# Title
The Chicago Case: Food inspections in a divided city

# Abstract
Chicago is a notoriously unequal city: Passengers travelling on its red metro line have life expectancies that vary by 30 years depending on which is their stop, according to The Economist. We want to investigate how geographical socio-economic divisions in Chicago reflect in food inspections in two ways: results to food inspections, and quantity of food inspections. By analysing results to food inspections, we want to find out which areas are performing better and which are performing worse, and compare this to the known socioeconomic divide. By analysing the quantity of inspections per area, we hope to gain insight on a potential bias in the choice of inspected establishment and whether the chances of a place getting inspected depend only on its performance or also on its location.


# Research questions
How does the intense geographical socio-economic inequality that exists in Chicago, and which we can measure looking at indicators such as income on life expectancy, show in the results to the food inspections being carried out?  

How to best analyse the violations that are reported when an establishment doesnâ€™t pass an inspection?

Is there a correlation between the type of facility being inspected (restaurant, Hopital, tavern) and the results of the inspection?

Is there a bias in which establishment gets picked more often for an inspection, or does it only depend on its performance?

# Dataset
1) Chicago Food Inspections: A dataset providing the time, latitude and longitude, result (pass, or fail, and risk level), and a short comment on the inspection.

2) Cencus Data - Seleted socioeconomic indicators in Chicago, 2008 - 2012 (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2). This dataset provides information on income per capita per area.

3) Public Health Statistics- Life Expectancy By Community Area Health (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Life-Expectancy-By-Commun/qjr3-bm53). This dataset provides information on life expectancy per capita per area.

The city of Chicago offers a wide variety of datasets of which we might take advantage in the future, and which might allow us to analyse other aspects of geographical inequality in Chicago, such as crime, population density, education, etc.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
1) Download all 3 datasets. Clean if needed. Report basic statistics on the important fields.

2) Analyse and visualize the Chicago food inspections: At what time of day they happen, where do they happen most frequently. Plot a map with the geographical food inspection result & quantity per area.

3) Analyse and visualize the socioeconomic indicators: Visualize in the map the rich/poor divide in Chicago.

# Questions for TAa
1) Do you think our research questions are too general: should we be more specific?
2) Are our datasets relevant?
3) Do you think working with 3 datasets might be too ambitious?
4) Is there any other source of information that could be relevant for the topic?
