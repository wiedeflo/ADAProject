  <h1 class="w3-center">Abstract</h1><br>
  <p class="w3-large">Chicago is a notoriously unequal city: Passengers travelling on its red metro line have life expectancies that vary by 30 years depending on their stop, according to The Economist. We want to investigate how geographical socio-economic divisions in Chicago reflect in food inspections in two ways: results to food inspections, and quantities of food inspections. By analysing results to food inspections, we want to find out which areas are performing better and which are performing worse, and compare this to measures of the socio-economic divide. By inspecting the quantity of inspections per area, we hope to gain insight on a potential bias in the choice of inspected establishment and whether the chances of an establishment getting inspected depend only on its performance or also on its location.</p>

      <h4>Number of Inspections</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The heatmap shows the number of inspections on the area we are focusing on and determined before. We can see that the more we approach the city center of Chicago, the higher the number of inspections. <br>However, it is also curious to see that in the north of Chicago, the number of inspections is higher than in the south. This could be due to a higher amount of establishment in this area; we check this below.</p><br>

      <h4>Number of Establishments</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The heatmap shows the number of establishments on the area we want to analyze. Same as before, we observe that the more we approach the city center or the north of the city, the higher the number of establishments. Indeed, the number of inspections is correlated with the number of establishments; the more establishments we have on a given area, the higher the inspections will be on that area.</p><br>

      <h4>Average risk per inspection for each area</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The heatmap shows the average risk of the establishments for each community area. The risk of an establishment shows how it could potentially affect the public's health with 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest. Furthermore, <b>high risk establishments are inspected more frequently that low risk establishments</b>.</p><br>

      <h4>Number of Inspections per establishment</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The heatmap shows the number of inspections per establishment and as highlighted before, we can see that the establishments with a high number of inspections present high average risks. </p><br>
